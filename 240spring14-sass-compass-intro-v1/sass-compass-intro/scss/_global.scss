//Some Responsive styles

//border-box model
/* apply a natural box layout model to all elements */
*, *:before, *:after {
	@include box-sizing(border-box);
}

/* This is not the only thing you should do for responsive images, but it is a start. Remember that this style will not make your image or video grow any bigger than the original so you have to put in the largest version you will need.
That can be a performance issue since small screens will download the same image as large ones.
This article by Luke Wroblewski goes into more detail about that: http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1851
